# Potential Improvements
There are some potential improvements I wanted to list out but didn't have the chance to tackle. One feature I didn't have the chance to get to was handling state of the app. For example, I would've liked to safely update the UI if a user lost connection or handle other errors that might've happened when fetching and creating data. In my current implementation I throw errors, but don't handle them on the UI.

Building off of this, the addition of logs when errors do happen is another area that could ehance the project. This would be beneficial for tracking errors or crashes in the backend service. A few files mention this where I'm handling the error that was thrown.

There's always room for improvement in a project, but these are just some I wanted to highlight. I'm curious to hear about other improvements I could make!

# Conclusion
Thanks for the oppurtunity, reach out if I can clarify anything!
